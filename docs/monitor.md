# DirFuzz Monitor

## Overview

The Monitor is a lightweight, standalone runner that periodically exercises a target web application using the DirFuzz engine and records a compact state snapshot of responses. It's intended for continuous, scheduled checks to detect configuration changes, content drift, regressions, or newly exposed paths.

## Key features

- Periodic scans of a target using the same fuzzing engine used by DirFuzz.
- Configurable scan interval and jitter to stagger runs across instances.
- JSONL state persistence (atomic writes) so each run produces a durable snapshot.
- Detection of content drift and size/duration changes; keeps previous state for comparison.
- Optional Discord webhook alerting for interesting findings (optional, not required).
- Configurable HTTP methods, headers, extensions and match status codes.
- Safe defaults and operator controls (e.g., private target scanning guarded by env var).

## How it works

1. The monitor reads configuration from environment variables.
2. On each cycle it instantiates an Engine configured with the provided wordlist/target.
3. It runs a scan over the wordlist and collects `Result` records for matches (status, size, headers, timing, etc.).
4. A SHA256 body hash is computed per-path (if raw bodies are available) to detect content changes reliably.
5. Results are written atomically to the configured state file in JSONL format.
6. If a finding is considered "interesting" (status code, content or size drift), it is logged and — if configured — sent to the Discord webhook.

## Output / State file

The monitor writes a JSONL file (one JSON object per line) containing a snapshot of `engine.Result` plus a `body_hash` field. Example fields you may see:

- `path` — the fuzzed path (relative path)
- `status` — HTTP status code
- `length` — response body size in bytes
- `words`, `lines` — simple content metrics
- `content_type` — detected Content-Type header
- `duration` — request duration
- `url` — full URL (if available)
- `request`, `response` — raw request/response (present only when the engine is configured to save raw data)
- `content_drift`, `old_size`, `old_words`, `drift_delta_bytes`, `old_status` — fields used to indicate changes compared to the previous snapshot
- `body_hash` — SHA256 (hex) of the normalized response body used for robust content-change detection

Because the file is JSONL and written atomically, it can be ingested by other tools, archived, or diffed by operator scripts.

## Configuration (environment variables)

The monitor is configured exclusively via environment variables. Important ones:

- `TARGET` (required): base target URL, e.g. `https://example.com`.
- `WORDLIST` (required): path to the wordlist used for fuzzing.
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` (optional): if set, monitors will POST findings to this webhook; otherwise findings are logged only.
- `STATE_FILE` (optional): path for the JSONL snapshot. Defaults to `/data/state.jsonl`.
- `SCAN_INTERVAL` (optional): e.g. `1h`, `30m`. Defaults to `1h`. Very short intervals are clamped to a safe minimum.
- `SCAN_JITTER` (optional): add random jitter (e.g. `10m`) to stagger multiple monitors.
- `WORKERS` (optional): number of concurrent workers used by the internal engine.
- `MATCH_CODES` (optional): comma-separated status codes considered hits (default `200,301,302,403`).
- `METHOD` (optional): specific HTTP method to use.
- `HEADERS` (optional): semicolon-separated `Key:Value` pairs for custom headers.
- `EXTENSIONS` (optional): comma-separated file extensions to append during fuzzing.
- `LOG_LEVEL` (optional): `info` or `debug`.
- `ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` (optional): `true|false` to allow scanning private IPs/hosts (use with caution).

For full control of the engine there are additional configuration knobs exposed in code; use environment variables and the engine API for advanced use cases.

## Benefits of using the Monitor

- Continuous visibility: detects regressions and unexpected content changes quickly.
- Low operational overhead: runs the same engine used for one-off scans, so results are consistent with your local runs.
- Alerting-ready: add `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` to receive near-real-time notifications when new findings are discovered.
- Durable, auditable state snapshots via JSONL make it easy to track changes over time or feed into downstream automation.

## Best practices

- Run the monitor from a small, dedicated host or container with a stable schedule (cron/kubernetes CronJob, systemd timer, etc.).
- Configure `SCAN_JITTER` when running multiple monitors to avoid thundering herds.
- Keep `SCAN_INTERVAL` at a reasonable cadence for the target (hourly/daily), and avoid very tight intervals unless you understand the load impact.
- Use `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` or other alerting connectors only for confirmed, high-confidence findings to avoid noise.
- Store `STATE_FILE` on persistent storage (or object storage) if you want long-term history.

## Example run

Populate environment and run the binary (example):

```bash
export TARGET=https://example.com
export WORDLIST=./wordlists/common.txt
export STATE_FILE=./monitor_state.jsonl
export SCAN_INTERVAL=1h
# optional: export DISCORD_WEBHOOK="https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/..."
./cmd/monitor/monitor
```

(Replace the binary path with your preferred run method, e.g. `go run ./cmd/monitor` or a packaged container.)

## Running in Docker

The monitor is designed to run in containerized environments. You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build the monitor image or run it as part of the broader DirFuzz container.

### Build the Docker image

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t dirfuzz-monitor:latest -f Dockerfile --target monitor .
```

### Run the monitor container

```bash
docker run \
  -e TARGET="https://example.com" \
  -e WORDLIST="/data/wordlists/common.txt" \
  -e STATE_FILE="/data/state.jsonl" \
  -e SCAN_INTERVAL="1h" \
  -v /path/to/wordlist:/data/wordlists:ro \
  -v /path/to/state:/data:rw \
  dirfuzz-monitor:latest
```

### Using `.env` file with Docker Compose

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# .env
TARGET_1=https://example.com
TARGET_2=https://api.example.com
TARGET_3=https://admin.example.com
WORDLIST=/wordlists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
STATE_FILE=/data/state.jsonl
SCAN_INTERVAL=1h
SCAN_JITTER=10m
WORKERS=50
MATCH_CODES=200,301,302,403
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

Docker Compose will automatically load these variables; no need to pass them on the command line.

### Docker Compose example

For easy orchestration with other services:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  monitor:
    image: dirfuzz-monitor:latest
    container_name: dirfuzz-monitor
    environment:
      TARGET: "https://example.com"
      WORDLIST: "/data/wordlists/common.txt"
      STATE_FILE: "/data/state.jsonl"
      SCAN_INTERVAL: "1h"
      SCAN_JITTER: "10m"
      LOG_LEVEL: "info"
      # optional: DISCORD_WEBHOOK: "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/..."
    volumes:
      - ./wordlists:/data/wordlists:ro
      - monitor-state:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  monitor-state:
```

Run with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes CronJob example

For scheduled monitoring in Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: dirfuzz-monitor
spec:
  schedule: "0 * * * *"  # Every hour
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: monitor
            image: dirfuzz-monitor:latest
            env:
            - name: TARGET
              value: "https://example.com"
            - name: WORDLIST
              value: "/data/wordlists/common.txt"
            - name: STATE_FILE
              value: "/data/state.jsonl"
            - name: SCAN_INTERVAL
              value: "30m"
            - name: DISCORD_WEBHOOK
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: dirfuzz-secrets
                  key: discord-webhook
            volumeMounts:
            - name: wordlists
              mountPath: /data/wordlists
              readOnly: true
            - name: state
              mountPath: /data
          volumes:
          - name: wordlists
            configMap:
              name: dirfuzz-wordlists
          - name: state
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: monitor-state-pvc
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## Troubleshooting & notes

- If you rely on raw request/response storage for reliable content hashing, make sure the engine is configured to retain raw data; otherwise `body_hash` may be empty.
- The monitor is conservative about private/internal IP targets; enabling `ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` bypasses the guard and should be done intentionally.
- The JSONL state is intended as a compact, machine-friendly snapshot. If you need richer change history, archive snapshots externally (timestamped files) and diff them.
